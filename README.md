======================
Hello. I'm a web developer working for a company called [Wizbit Internet Services] making attractive, responsive websites in WordPress. Although occasionally clients have requested a particular theme to use, we generally build from scratch, using our own custom themes.

Commercial Projects
-------------------

Since starting at [Wizbit] last year, I have created many websites. Recent ones of note are:

| [Griffin Glasshouses] | [Landau UK] | [Oakley Hall Park] |
|-------------  |-------------  |-------------
| Griffin Glasshouses are a company who design and build bespoke glasshouses and they needed a website to match the quality of there products. I had to use a variety of tools at my disposal, including Advanced Custom Fields Pro as well as various custom post types to create all the features they required, such as the collection menu with images and various content fields. | Landau is a fairly major player in the world of Yacht accessories. This site is one I built a little while ago, perhaps in March 2016 and again was built in WordPress. Again, I used Advanced Custom Fields Pro to give further customisation options to the site. Due to my template layout, using HTML5, CSS3 and PHP, as well as a little sprinkle of jQuery, every box, image and area of text is completely editable by a user with no web design knowledge. | Oakley Hall Park is a local Hotel in Hampshire, UK. We've recenty relaunched their new website giving it a fresher look on the outside, and a much more streamlined and fluid admin system on the inside than it had before. Once again, Advanced Custom Fields features a lot in this site, for features such as creating a gallery for the page sliders which saves them creating lots of bulky slides with Slider Revolution. We also used a lot of child page systems so that their parent pages could automatically generate child page data and render it on the screen, again making the backend a lot easier to manage.

Code examples

The code I worked on in my course is still available for viewing on my GitHub account.

Some particular projects that stand out are listed below.

| [Flickynotes] | [Fundrmental] | [Tournament project] |
|-------------  |-------------  |-------------
| For our final project, using Meteor, which we had never used before, 6 of us made an app that required writing notes on your smartphone and swiping, or 'flicking' them to a column based table on a computer screen. We could also use the phone's accelerometer information to move notes from one column to another. Deployed on [Meteor](http://flickynotes.meteor.com) | Rails web app that is a kickstarter for university funders, so backers have more control on what their money is spent on. Also hosted on [Heroku](https://fundrmental.herokuapp.com). | As an 'extra-curricular' activity, we decided to make a tournament app to make use of the ever popular table tennis table at Makers Academy. Built in Ruby using Sinatra. Deployed on [Heroku](https://makersttt.herokuapp.com).

About myself
-

I have always had a passion for creativity. Since the age of 8, I have had a love for music and have become a proficient and disciplined pianist, as well as an able guitarist. After studying music for my 'A' levels, I decided to take my creativity in a different direction at university by studying Video Production and Creative Writing. Recently I have ventured into yet another creative area by doing a 12 week programming course at Makers Academy.
