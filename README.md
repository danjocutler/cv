======================
Hello. I'm a web developer working for a company called [Tempcover.com]. I am responsible for all front end work related to the website including building the WordPress site (there's also a .NET side where the quote engine lives), styling all areas of the site, working with the SEO team to see that everything is as efficient as possible in that area and making sure releases go out in a smooth and timely manner.

Commercial Projects
-------------------

| [Tempcover.com] | [Griffin Glasshouses] | [Oakley Hall Park] |
|-------------  |-------------  |-------------
| Tempcover are a leading short term insurance company that provide policies for cars, vans, motorbikes and homes. This site has seen a large transformation since I joined the company as more focus has been on improving the look of the site and the user experience. Here I have built on all my programming skills as well as played more of a role in decision making for the company. | Griffin Glasshouses are a company who design and build bespoke glasshouses and they needed a website to match the quality of there products. I had to use a variety of tools at my disposal, including Advanced Custom Fields Pro as well as various custom post types to create all the features they required, such as the collection menu with images and various content fields. | Oakley Hall Park is a local Hotel in Hampshire, UK. We've recenty relaunched their new website giving it a fresher look on the outside, and a much more streamlined and fluid admin system on the inside than it had before. Once again, Advanced Custom Fields features a lot in this site, for features such as creating a gallery for the page sliders which saves them creating lots of bulky slides with Slider Revolution. We also used a lot of child page systems so that their parent pages could automatically generate child page data and render it on the screen, again making the backend a lot easier to manage.

About myself
-

I have always had a passion for creativity. Since the age of 8, I have had a love for music and have become a proficient and disciplined pianist, as well as an able guitarist. After studying music for my 'A' levels, I decided to take my creativity in a different direction at university by studying Video Production and Creative Writing. Recently I have ventured into yet another creative area by doing a 12 week programming course at Makers Academy.
