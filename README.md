Daniel Joseph Cutler
======================
I'm a junior web developer. I enjoy using computers and I love making software that makes people's lives easier or more enjoyable - I also like to keep up to date with cutting edge technology. I'm currently working for [Wizbit Internet Services] making attractive, responsive websites in WordPress. Although occasionally clients have requested a particular theme to use, we generally build from scratch, using our own custom themes.

#Commercial Projects

Since starting in my role as a junior web developer at [Wizbit Internet Services] last year, I have created many websites. Some of note are:

| [Victorious] | [Landau UK] | [Trimetals] |
|-------------  |-------------  |-------------
| The Victorious Festival has been steadily growing in popularity in Portsmouth each year, and the company I work for have been doing their website since 2013. My role in this site, as with most other sites I build at work, was to take the initial 'static' front page design and build it into a fully functioning WordPress site. This was one of my first projects. Of note on this for me was learning how to create and style accordions using html, css and JavaScript | Landau is a fairly major player in the world of Yacht accessories. This site is one I built more recently, perhaps in March 2016 and again was built in WordPress. We also used a plugin called 'Advanced Custom Fields'. Basically this gives further customisation to one's site. Due to my template layout, using HTML5, CSS3 and PHP, every box, image and area of text is completely editable by a user with no web design knowledge. | The final example I would like to show you is of a large e-commerce site we created for Trimetals, a metal garden shed company. This is one of the first sites I started working on when I started at Wizbit, and we use our own in-house theme as well as our own e-commerce system.

#Code examples

Since being in employment, I haven't committed much code to any public repos. However, the code I worked on in my course is still available for viewing on my GitHub account.

Some particular projects that stand out are listed below.

| [Flickynotes] | [Fundrmental] | [Tournament project] |
|-------------  |-------------  |-------------
| For our final project, using Meteor, which we had never used before, 6 of us made an app that required writing notes on your smartphone and swiping, or 'flicking' them to a column based table on a computer screen. We could also use the phone's accelerometer information to move notes from one column to another. Deployed on [Meteor](http://flickynotes.meteor.com) | Rails web app that is a kickstarter for university funders, so backers have more control on what their money is spent on. Also hosted on [Heroku](https://fundrmental.herokuapp.com). | As an 'extra-curricular' activity, we decided to make a tournament app to make use of the ever popular table tennis table at Makers Academy. Built in Ruby using Sinatra. Deployed on [Heroku](https://makersttt.herokuapp.com).

#About myself

I have always had a passion for creativity. Since the age of 8, I have had a love for music and have become a proficient and disciplined pianist, as well as an able guitarist. After studying music for my 'A' levels, I decided to take my creativity in a different direction at university by studying Video Production and Creative Writing. Recently I have ventured into yet another creative area by doing a 12 week programming course at Makers Academy.
