======================
I'm a junior web developer. I enjoy using computers and I love making software that makes people's lives easier or more enjoyable - I also like to keep up to date with cutting edge technology.

Code examples

| In our final project, in a team of six, we made an app that required writing notes on your smartphone and swiping, or 'flicking' them to a column based table on a computer screen. We could also use the phone's accelerometer information to move notes from one column to another. Deployed on [Meteor](http://flickynotes.meteor.com) | Rails web app that is a kickstarter for university funders, so backers have more control on what their money is spent on. Also hosted on [Heroku](https://fundrmental.herokuapp.com). | Insert third example here |
