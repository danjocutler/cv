| For our final project, using Meteor, which we had never used before, 6 of us made an app that required writing notes on your smartphone and swiping, or 'flicking' them to a column based table on a computer screen. We could also use the phone's accelerometer information to move notes from one column to another. Deployed on [Meteor](http://flickynotes.meteor.com) | Rails web app that is a kickstarter for university funders, so backers have more control on what their money is spent on. Also hosted on [Heroku](https://fundrmental.herokuapp.com). | To get used to Sinatra and postgresql database, I built a basic twitter clone where a user can log in and write tweets, or 'peeps', for all to see. Also hosted on [Heroku](https://twitface.herokuapp.com/) | As an 'extra-curricular' activity, we decided to make a tournament app to make use of the ever popular table tennis table at Makers Academy. Deployed on [Heroku](https://makersttt.herokuapp.com)

#About myself

I have always had a passion for creativity. Since the age of 8, I have had a love for music and have become a proficient and disciplined pianist, as well as an able guitarist.
